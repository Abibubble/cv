                <li>I am a keen musician, having played various brass instruments from the age of 12.</li>
                <li>I currently play trombone in a ska band, regularly performing gigs on the weekends.</li>
                <li>I have been a member of various brass bands since 2005, including Cinderford Brass Band and Yiewsley
                    and West Drayton Brass Band.</li>
                <li>I also ran and conducted the Yiewsley and West Drayton Training Band for the young (and young at heart).</li>

                <li>I have been a member of Girlguiding UK since 2000, as a Brownie and a Guide.</li>
                <li>I helped start a new Young Leader unit for ages 14 to 25 in 2007, and I participated in and helped
                    run several large scale events in Gloucestershire.</li>
                <li>As an adult, I have recently opened up a Guide unit in my area, as a unit leader. We only have 8
                    Guides at the moment, but we're taking it slowly due to lockdowns.</li>

                <li>At my previous jobs, I've been the person to implement recycling measures for the business, even
                    saving money for the pub when I worked at Wetherspoons.</li>

                <li>I have a newly discovered love of coding, and I'm learning new things every day in a variety of
                    programming languages.</li>
                <li>I enjoy seeing how different languages link together, and discovering the challenges that a new
                    language causes.</li>
