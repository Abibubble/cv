    <p><i id="skillone" class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i> I am a keen musician, having played various brass instruments from the age of 12. I currently play trombone in a ska band, regularly performing gigs on the weekends. I have been a member of various brass bands since 2005, including Cinderford Brass Band and Yiewsley and West Drayton Brass Band. I also ran and conducted the Yiewsley and West Drayton Training Band for the young (and young at heart).</p>
