                    <i id="skillone" class="fa fa-music" aria-hidden="true"></i> I am a keen musician, having played various brass instruments from the age of 12. 
                    I currently play trombone in a ska band, regularly performing gigs on the weekends. 
                    I have been a member of various brass bands since 2005, including Cinderford Brass Band and Yiewsley and West Drayton Brass Band. 
                    I also ran and conducted the Yiewsley and West Drayton Training Band for the young (and young at heart).

                    I helped start a new Young Leader unit for ages 14 to 25 in 2007, and I participated in and helped run several large scale events in Gloucestershire. 
                    As an adult, I have opened up a Guide unit in my area, as a unit leader.
