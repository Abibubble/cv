## Design
### Color Scheme
* mistyRose, skyBlue, mediumPurple were used for the background, to give an impression of what I'm like as a person (they're my favourite colors).
* Black is used for text, so as to be easy to read over any background colors.
* White is used for the navigation before mouse over, and skyBlue is used on mouse over. This is for a clean aesthetic that also links in with the background color.

### Typography
* I have used Arial in this site, as it's a clean and easy to read font.
* Arial is also a built-in font for HTML, so it won't have any issues being displayed on other browsers.

### Imagery
* The background is a linear gradient of three light colors, which give an immediate impression of my personality.
* I have included images of my finished projects within my portfolio section, to demonstrate how they look without having to click off my CV.

### Wireframes
[Here are the wireframes for desktop, mobile and tablet for this project](wireframes.pdf).

### Features
* Navigation bar visible on every page, with links to every page on the site for easy navigation.
* Links to my portfolio projects.
