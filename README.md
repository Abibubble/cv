## Design
### Color Scheme
* The linear-gradient used as the background uses #EB5F8E, #FE981D, #FCC31E, #35ADCE. I built this for the giffgaff Have A Proper Chat campaign, and it reflects my personality quite well too.
* Black is used for text, so as to be easy to read over any background colors.
* #c99de2 is used for the navigation before mouse over, and skyBlue is used on mouse over, with #996ccc for the active page. This is for a clean aesthetic that also links in with the bright background colors.

![Image of colors used](colors.png)

### Typography
* I have used Arial in this site, as it's a clean and easy to read font.
* Arial is also a built-in font for HTML, so it won't have any issues being displayed on other browsers.

### Imagery
* The background is a linear gradient of four bright colors, which give an immediate impression of my personality.
* I have included images of my finished projects within my portfolio section, to demonstrate how they look without having to click off my CV.

### Features
* Navigation bar visible on every page, with links to every page on the site for easy navigation.
* Links to my portfolio projects.
* Links to videos of my ska band to show what I do in my free time.
* Downloadable PDF files of my work with giffgaff.

### Further Testing
The website was tested on Google Chrome, Firefox, Microsoft Edge, Safari and Samsung Internet browsers. I did not test this site on Internet Explorer, due to it being depreciated in favour of Microsoft Edge.
The website was viewed on a variety of devices, including:
* Custom built desktop PC, running Windows 10
* Acer Aspire V Nitro Laptop, running Windows 10
* Lenovo B51 IntelCore i7 Laptop, running Ubuntu 16.04 LTS
* MacBookAir7,2 (13-inch, 2017)
* iPad 6,11 5th generation, running iOS 10.3
* Amazon Fire tablet 7
* iPhone 7
* iPhone X
* iPhone 12
* OPPO Find X2 Lite
* Samsung Galaxy A70
* Samsung Galaxy S9
* Samsung Galaxy S10+
* Samsung A20
* xBox One

A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were visible or hidden correctly, all buttons worked as they should, and the quiz played out as it should.
Friends, family members, and other developers were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues that they came across.

### Solved Bugs
1. None at present.

### Known Bugs
* The navigation bar is not responsive. This is currently being worked on.

### Lighthouse
I tested my website using DevTools Lighthouse feature, and got these results:

#### Desktop
![Lighthouse desktop first try](assets/images/docs/lighthouse-desktop.png)

#### Mobile
![Lighthouse mobile first try](assets/images/docs/lighthouse-mobile.png)

#### Performance:
* The only place this site is losing performance is from the [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/) scripts, which are slightly blocking rendering.

#### Accessibility:
* I made sure that every image used has alt text attached to it, for those who use screen readers.
* I ensured that my background and foreground colors had sufficient contrast so that it wouldn't be difficult for those who are color blind to read any text.
* All links are meaningful, so the text inside describes what the link leads to.

#### Best Practices:
* As I didn't use any libraries or frameworks in this site, I avoided any security risks.
* All images are at the correct resolution.

#### SEO:
* All meta tags have been used correctly.
* All links are crawlable.
