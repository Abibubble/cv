                I manage a team to their abilities, learning people's strengths and working to maximise efficiency.
I am friendly and sociable, working well with colleagues, and dealing with customers in a friendly and polite manner, no matter the situation.
I work well under pressure, maintaining a high standard of work, with a keen eye for detail.
I adapt to change quickly and easily, and am often the person leading the team in those changes.
Decent knowledge of conversational French
I am a musician, having played various brass instruments from the age of 12. I currently play in a ska band, regularly performing gigs on the weekends, as well as having a hand in writing new songs, and helping with the recording process.
I love gaming, both socially and in my free time across a variety of different platforms (retro and modern).
I enjoy learning new coding languages, and implementing what I learn on personal projects.
