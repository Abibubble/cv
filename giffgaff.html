                    <h3>FAQ Shortcode</h3>
                    <p>
                        I needed to create a valid <a href="https://gohugo.io/" target="_blank">Hugo</a> shortcode for a Frequently Asked Questions section 
                        for use in the giffgaff design system site, to help other developers keep the giffgaff website looking uniform and on-brand throughout 
                        the site. I also has to include a section in the documentation to explain how this should be used. I had a few difficulties whilst 
                        completing this, the first one being that I needed the developer to be able to add as many list items to their FAQ section as they 
                        needed to.
                    </p>
                    <p>To solve this, I created two shortcodes, the first one is the ul shortcode, which surrounds the list. Inside the ul 
                        shortcode, the developer can then add as many versions of the li shortcode as they'd like, to correspond with how many FAQs they 
                        need to include. The li shortcode then takes the content of the li as a variable, which allows the developer to add thier FAQ text 
                        and even code, for it to display on the website how they would like.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Design Token Imports</h3>
                    <p>
                        The giffgaff design system is set up from the styleguide. On the design system site, it wasn't automatically updating from 
                        the styleguide, which meant that any time the styleguide was changed or added to, the design system site had to be manually updated 
                        to match. This was a waste of time at best, and at worst, it could end up with design styles being used incorrectly, or just missed 
                        altogether.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My challenge was to ensure that this updating was automated, as well as making sure that the code was displayed in the correct 
                        coding language format for each developer depending on how they were using the styles. I set up a language shortcode in Hugo with an 
                        if / else statement, which takes the styleguide directly from the source, and takes the language entered as the shortcode variable. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I then used PrismJS to find the correct formatting for each language, and ran the styleguide through the relevant formatting 
                        before displaying it on the design system site. My only lingering issue from this is that LESS doesn't display with the correct 
                        colour highlighting, which appears to be a small issue with PrismJS. I ran this through as CSS instead to get an easily readable 
                        format.

                        This was my first project from within the BI & Ops team. I was asked to take a look at the free SIM order pages, and look at 
                        whether those pages were underperforming in any way, and present a hypothesis and a potential solution.
