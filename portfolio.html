                    <li>
                        This is a cocktail recipe site, made for bartenders, by bartenders. It's built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, Flask, Jinja, 
                        MaterializeCSS and MongoDB.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I chose to use MaterializeCSS framework for this project, as I hadn't used Materialize before and wanted to experiment with its use.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        This was my first full-stack project, and it was really exciting getting to see users registering to the site and adding their own 
                        cocktails.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        I used the Jinja templating language for this project so as to easily populate the data onto my site. I've had some experience using 
                        Hugo in the past, and this was very alike, so I enjoyed it.

                <ul>
                    <li>This is an informative history site, themed around LGBTQ+ Pride. It was created by my team in the Code Institute June 2021 Hackathon, with the theme 
                        of 'Proud Coders' from 16th to 21st June.
                    </li>
                    <li>We put a particular focus on styling, using the following:
                        <ul>
                            <li>We used Bootstrap to enable us to create the base styling quickly and easily, as we were very limited on time.</li>
                            <li>We chose not to use jQuery due to associated security issues and slow load times.</li>
                            <li>We ensured that all images were sized correctly for the largest image size, then scaled down properly with responsive design.</li>
                            <li>We created a basic JavaScript function to show or hide the information as the user wishes.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>It is built with HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript, as it's a very basic project, make for my Girl Guide unit for a Harry Potter-themed sleepover.</li>
                    <li>I intend to add further functionality in the form of questions to decide which house the user is in, in the future.</li>

                            <li>We created a flip animation for the cards, using a mix of CSS and JavaScript.</li>

                    </li>

                    <li>I chose not to use any libraries or frameworks for this project for several reasons:
                        <ul>
                            <li>To showcase my coding and debugging skills, which I feel I didn't do as well as I could
                                in the Esape Pool Bar website, due to using Bootstrap.</li>
                            <li>Due to the performance trade-offs often caused by libraries and frameworks.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>This was my first project built using JavaScript, and I really enjoyed the freedom and
                        flexibility that JavaScript gave me.</li>

                    <li>This was the first full project I built whilst learning to code, and I learnt a lot about
